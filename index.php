                <p>In order to choose the best foods for hiking, you need to strike the right balance. Ideally, you should eat foods that are tasty and packed with nutrients, but they should also be light and portable. In contrast to running and cycling, you don't just consider fuelling your effort. If you plan on hiking for a few days, you may need to consider lunches and even post-hike dinners while you're still in the wilderness.</p>

                <p>It doesn't have to be complicated to devise the optimal fuelling strategy, and Hike Foodie can help. Natural nutrition is all we do, so we're here with hiking food ideas based on our expertise. You will also learn how to prepare healthy, delicious fuel for your walks.</p>        

                <h2>The right calories</h2>

                <p>To avoid weight loss and keep up your energy levels, you need to eat the right amount of calories while hiking. Hiking burns around 3500 calories each day on average. However, the amount of calories burned by an individual depends on their weight. Weight is generally a determinant of how many calories you burn. An individual weighing 70 kg might burn around 440 calories per hour hiking, while an individual weighing 90 kg might burn up to 550 calories per hour.</p>

                <p>Therefore, you should make sure to eat enough food for your hike in order to burn enough calories. Experts recommend consuming 2000 calories for easy hikes and over 4,500 calories for severe terrain and cold weather trips. This is because the number of calories you burn can vary depending on your location and environment. For example, trekking on flat, rocky terrain burns more calories than hiking on flat, grassy terrain. Using a heavy pack will increase the amount of calories burned. The more difficult the hike, the more calories you'll burn, so plan your route and the circumstances you'll experience ahead of time.</p>

                <h2>The right nutrition</h2>

                <p>While it's always vital to eat well, the most important thing to remember when hiking is to keep your energy levels up. So, in addition to protein, carbs should play a significant role in your diet. A mixture of basic and complex carbs should be included in your diet. Simple carbohydrates might provide an immediate energy boost. Natural foods, such as fruits and milk, as well as processed refined sugars, such as sweets, syrups, and soft drinks, contain them. Complex carbohydrates give a slower and more sustained flow of energy because they take longer to breakdown. They can be found in bread, rice, and pasta, among other things.</p>

                <p>It's best to mix these two carbohydrates together so that you get a sustained energy release during your hike as well as fast spurts of energy throughout the day. For example, you may start your day with complex carbs, such as a bowl of porridge, and then snack on simple carbs, such as raisins, dried fruits, and energy bars, throughout the day. You might end the day with a complex carb meal, such as chicken with pasta or rice, in addition to refuelling at lunch.</p>

                <p>Fats, in addition to protein and carbohydrates, are a good supplement to your journey because they are high in energy and calorie density. They have roughly nine calories per gramme, as opposed to four calories per gramme for protein and carbs. It's better to eat foods that are high in healthy fats, such as almonds, which are great for snacking on while hiking. Foods with a high fibre content are also worth considering because they help you feel fuller for longer.</p>

                <h2>When and how often to eat</h2>

                <p>It's not just about what you eat on a trek, but also when you eat. To stay energised during the day, you should eat on a regular basis. This is especially true if you're eating simple carbohydrates, which provide short spurts of energy that quickly wear off. It's a good idea to aim to eat every two hours to gently and consistently drip carbs into your system, preventing energy spikes and troughs.</p>

                <p>You should have a large breakfast before starting your hike and refill within one hour of ending. It's also a good idea to eat about half an hour before bedtime to try to replenish the energy you expended on your journey, especially if you plan on hiking the next day. </p>
