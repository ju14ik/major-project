                <!-- <p>One of the most satisfying moments of any backpacking trip is sitting down at the end of the day to enjoy a well-deserved meal. The beautiful scenery, the good company, and our ravenous hunger all work together to create an unforgettable experience.</p>
                <img src="./images/meal.jpg" alt="" title="Easy backpacking healthy meal"/>
                <p>However, not all backpacking meals are created equal. While there is certainly a time and a place for freeze-dried meals, they can get quite expensive and the selection can be somewhat limiting.</p>
                <p>Making your own backpacking food can dramatically reduce the cost per meal, open a wide range of recipe options, and allow you to really customize your nutritional profile. You just need to know where to start!</p> -->
